# Mandarin OS
MandarinOS is a project to create an operating system that supports Windows and MacOS applications for a seamless workflow.

We are starting off by making it as an application to see what it will be like before we make the operating system.

You can now find old releases without digging into the commits!

We are making a changelog! We will only add newer updates not old ones.
